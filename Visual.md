## ✏️ Prompt #1 — Custom Scene + Identity Preservation  

Use this prompt when you want Anita to perform an action or be in a specific setting (e.g. going to the beach, eating ramen, or celebrating a website launch). The visual style and identity must remain 100% consistent with the original.
```bash
Use the uploaded image of Anita as the design reference.
Preserve the exact character style, including purple fur, glowing blue eyes, signature goggles, and soft cartoon lighting.

Now generate a new illustration where:

[YOUR IDEA HERE]

Examples:
	•	She’s relaxing on a beach under a Kraken umbrella
	•	She’s preparing breakfast in a sunny kitchen
	•	She’s watching charts explode on TV
	•	She’s casting magic celebrating InkChain passing $100M in volume
	•	She’s popping confetti to announce Anita.ink is live

Maintain Anita’s original style and proportions. Match her visual identity exactly. Keep the mood warm, soft, and magical.
```

## 🧵 Prompt #2 — Tweet-Aware Anime Visuals  

Use this to turn **viral tweets** or **major moments** into **anime-style visuals** that feel native to X (Twitter). The system will take the reference Anita and creatively combine it with the emotion, theme, or tone of the tweet.
```bash
Use the uploaded image of Anita as the visual identity reference.
Preserve all major character traits.

Now interpret this tweet and generate a highly shareable anime-style visual based on its message or mood:

[TWEET CONTEXT HERE]

Examples:
	•	“Anita is too powerful to fade” → Anita standing with cape in the wind
	•	“InkChain hit ATH” → Anita flying through clouds leaving ink trails
	•	“Website is finally live” → Anita with laptop in spotlight, surrounded by digital magic
	•	“VCs fading Ink” → Anita throwing a smug look with charts behind her

Keep the vibe adapted to the tweet: bold, cute, emotional, ironic — as needed.
Make it instantly retweetable and visually clean.
```

## ✨ Prompt #3 — Freestyle Magic Mode  

Use this when you want the AI to suggest something totally fresh based on Anita’s lore, without needing a tweet or task. It’s a “surprise me” prompt designed to inspire new formats, backgrounds, or expressions.
```bash
Using the uploaded image of Anita as the sole reference, generate a completely new illustration of Anita that surprises and delights — while strictly maintaining her visual identity.

Let the AI imagine new:
	•	Expressions
	•	Backgrounds
	•	Accessories
	•	Scene concepts

Make the visual feel like it’s from a new chapter in the “Legend of Anita.”
It should still feel:
	•	High quality
	•	Soft and expressive
	•	Familiar to the community

End result should feel fresh but unmistakably Anita.
```
